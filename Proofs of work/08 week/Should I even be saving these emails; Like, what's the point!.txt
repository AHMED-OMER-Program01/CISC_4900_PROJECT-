Hi professor!

Sorry this email's being sent out so late, time got away form me;
If you're still willing to do a zoom meeting together, I'm free anytime between 11:30AM and 6:00PM, friday!
I'm... not going to set-up the zoom link ahead of time; after last time.. ugh- If you're free Friday anytime within that timeframe, just let me know, I'll try to email you back a link or something closer to the actual timeframe. If you're not, just let me know too- maybe I can start making another video?

Sorry again about how hectic & lame I've been handling all this, it's been all getting sorta away from me!

Regardless, I hope you're doing well, and if I don't see you Friday, see you next week!

Cheers, professor!
