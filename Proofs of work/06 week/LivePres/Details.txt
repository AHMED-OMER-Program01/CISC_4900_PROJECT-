Afterward notes;;

God, I was a nervous wreck during all of that- 
Didn't even go through/use an/most of my notes! GAH;;
On criticism I need to take to heart;;
	Being more professional; being nervous is fine, but breaking down because of it is, counterproductive, non?
	They relayed a good notion on how user-friendliness is a key component for any application- a sentiment echoed by Prof Mcneill- I should focus on that more! Just needs some tweaks

Overall; was a productive & nice meeting- though I feel like I bungled the flow a bunch-
On the status of my project itself- they said it looks good! Which is sweet- I just need to keep getting at it, then! Yeah!
