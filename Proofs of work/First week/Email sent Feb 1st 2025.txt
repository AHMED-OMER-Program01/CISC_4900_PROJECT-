Subject:	Hey! Just a quick question; could you please be my 4900 project supervisor? Ahmed Omer; emplid: 24262668


      Hey professor! It's Ahmed; a student of yours; I was in your Fall's Java class, and am in this semester's CISC-3225?

      I know I should've shot this email like, last month, but things on got in the way; but, I'm doing CISC-4900 this semester, and since I know & trust you, alongside the fact I'll be seeing you twice a week through 3225... could you please be my supervisor?

      As far as I'm aware, all you'd have to do is let me see you during your office hours once every two weeks, and let me update you on my project, my plans with it, and showcase what I've done so far; then, throughout the semester if you could fill out two forms about your experience/how well you thing I'm doing?

      I know this is a decently lot to ask, so if it's a no-go, I completely understand! You've got classes, and this *is* a bit last minute; so if you'd rather not, just send a quick no, and I'll treat it like this email never happened! Otherwise, I'd be grateful for this opportunity, and to work with you! Regardless of acceptance ( sorry, lol ), I'll probably be asking for advice on my project ( I'm aiming on an educational/example exe-tool on Quantum-Resistant encryption algorithms; sounds complex, should surprisingly be easy; hardest part'll probably be internalizing the cryptography aspects ( lol ) ), so I'd love to fill you in on what I've planned for my project so far anyway!

      Er, yeah!

      Sorry again for being so dang last minute, but I hope that regardless of the answer, we have fun this upcoming monday!

      Cheers, professor!
            -Ahmed
