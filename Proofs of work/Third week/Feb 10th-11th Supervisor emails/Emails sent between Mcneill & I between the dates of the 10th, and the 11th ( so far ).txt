------------------------------
On the tenth of February; both before, and after class, we met up, and agreed to
meet up a period after class, to have our first more 'formal' meeting;
rest of the info is available contextually; and I'm 1,000% cool with it;
just documenting for documenting/proof I even interacted with Mcneill outside of class
( It's *not* paranoia if they ARE out to get you ( lol ) )
------------------------------

I sent this Feb 10th, 1:21PM;

"Ahmed Omer; I’ve been outside 128 for a bit; did I mishear you?"

"  Hey prof! Outside 128; I knocked a few times, and it's getting closer to 1:30;

   I apologize, I thought I was gonna meet you here at 1, since you said you had a 20-30 minute meeting? Were you, instead, saying you *only* had 20-30 minutes, before then/such?? Because if so, I'm sorry! I was waiting the time out in the library!!

    If you ARE in the office ( and I dunno, my knocking's just quiet, lol ), I'm out here! And if this email gets to you too late; I'm gonna share my GitHub;

   https://github.com/AHMED-OMER-Program01/

Which… does NOT have the more updated, local version, but hey, it’s a Proof of Concept for the Proof of Concept for the, etc?

   Gah.

   I dunno man, if I did something, I’m sorry. Since we’re not meeting next Wednesday, see you next week?

    Cheers, 
      -Ahmed


Ps; proof I was/am like.
Here, lmao;
"
I then proceeded to upload two pictures, which should be in the same folder as this .txt.

------------------------------

He sent this back/replied same day, 5:26 PM;

"Hi Ahmed,

I'm sorry, you heard me correctly, unfortunately the meeting went over and I must have missed you. I'd be happy to arrange a time on Zoom to meet later this week. In the meantime, I looked at your repository - your informal plan looks good to me, and I'm only curious about which encryption algorithms you're planning to implement.

      Absolutely! I'd love to have a zoom meeting; mind, I don't really have that much to share *actionably* right now; just timelogs, ideas, and like, the finished installer. I'll upload those items, and formalize the Github a bit later today, but, for the zoom meeting;

      If you're okay with it being a bit of a shorter one, I'm free;
            Literally anytime tomorrow
            Anytime between 11:00AM & 1:30PM Thursday,
            And anytime after 5:00PM, Friday?

      I apologize if this email-series is unprofessional, I'll be completely honest, I'm sorta-kinda flying by the seat of my pants here! I'm not the best at remote conferences either, so if I'm understanding this right, is it okay if I expect a quick 15-30 min meeting, with me presenting my gameplan and what I've done? Or, is there a more implicational segment to these meetings ( like, am I expected to treat this like how I would present my work to a *boss*, or, are more casual tones expected/okay? )?

      Apologies for the text-wall, and thank you for responding back so quickly! Also, no problem about/with the meeting yesterday! Guide me, professor ( lol )!

      Cheers,
        -Ahmed
